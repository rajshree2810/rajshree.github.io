                <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">HEY there!,Hope you are doing fine.I'm a tech enthusiast & exploring various things.Currently,studying at VNIT Nagpur.let me give you brief about VNIT. The institute's history can be traced back to 1947, when the Architecture Department was established by Madhya Pradesh Government.
                    In accordance with the second five-year plan (1956â€“60) in India, a number of industrial projects were contemplated. The Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs) were established by the central government to mimic the IITs at a regional level and act as benchmarks for the other colleges in that state.
                    For the Western region in the year of 1960, the Institute was established under the name Visvesvaraya Regional College of Engineering (VRCE). It was established under the scheme sponsored by Govt. of India and Govt. of Maharashtra. The college was started in June 1960 by amalgamating the State Govt. Engineering College functioning at Nagpur since July 1956. In the meeting held in October 1962, the Governing Board of the College resolved to name it after the eminent engineer, planner, and statesman of the country Sir M.Visvesvaraya.
